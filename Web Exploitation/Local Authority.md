# Local Authority
Here we start with going to a website where we are asked for username and password which are not known to us.
Note: Use `Ctrl` + `U` to open source code.
The website looks like this:-

![](./SS/Local%20Authority%20home.png)

The source code looks like this:-

![](./SS/Local%20Authority%20home%20sc.png)

Here we can see that the it redirects us to `login.php`
The code here is:-

![](./SS/Local%20Authority%20login%20sc-1.png) ![](./SS/Local%20Authority%20login%20sc-2.png)

Now there is a file `secure.jss` which contains the correct username and pswd
