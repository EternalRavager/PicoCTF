Here I opened the file and found the cube root of cipher text which came out as 
130163825294491060658944
793740276047504069536990
903653882037228010430523
39225981
After converting this to hex I got 
7069636F4354467B6E3333645F615F6C41726733725F655F64306364366561657D
I converted this to ascii to get the flag
picoCTF{n33d_a_lArg3r_e_d0cd6eae}
